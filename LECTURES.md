## Fair Artificial Intelligence (for bonus points)
### Background
Will AI that discriminates based on race, gender, or economic status undermine the public’s confidence in the technology? Seduced by the promise of cost savings and data-driven decision making, organizations will deploy biased systems that end up doing real-world damage. Systems incorporating biased algorithms or trained on biased data will misdiagnose medical patients, bar consumers from loans or insurance, deny parole to reformed convicts, or grant it to unrepentant ones. Biased implementations have raised public backlash as organizations both private and public figure out what AI can and can’t do, and how to use it properly.

* The UK recently [abandoned](https://www.statewatch.org/news/2020/august/uk-threat-of-legal-challenge-forces-home-office-to-abandon-racist-visa-algorithm/) an algorithm designed to streamline visa applications after human rights activists sued. The plaintiffs charged that the model discriminated against people from countries with large non-white populations.
* Financial regulators in New York last year launched an investigation into the algorithm behind Apple’s credit card. Users [reported](https://medium.com/@nydfs/building-a-fairer-and-more-inclusive-financial-services-industry-for-everyone-917183dae954) that women had received lower interest rates than men with comparable credit ratings.
* The Los Angeles Police Department adopted systems designed to forecast crimes, but it stopped using one and promised to revamp another after determining that they were [flawed](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/09/do-algorithms-have-place-policing/596851/). Some people identified as high-risk offenders, for instance, had no apparent history of violent crime.
