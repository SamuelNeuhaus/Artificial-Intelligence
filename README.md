**Teaching philosophy:** Computer science and technology is mostly a practical discipline. To learn the fundamentals, an effective strategy is to follow an iterative process of `reading, analyzing, and coding`. However, many students either like to `analyze` or `code` but not both. While some of us enjoy developing the skills for critically assessing the concepts and algorithms, many others enjoy programming and love building things. I think that an effective computer science course should be a balance of (a) theoretical knowledge to understand how computer technology works, and (b) implementation skills to test and execute the theories and algorithms. I design course contents and assignments so that students have an opportunity to improve both: analytical and programming skills. Students with a rich programming experience may find this balance slightly easier but will have a platform to explore further. For many others who do not consider themselves expert programmers, taking such a course will be a rewarding experience.

## 2. Course description in UMSL catalog
> This course provides an introduction to artificial intelligence (AI). The list of topics may include artificial neural networks, search, planning, knowledge-based reasoning, probabilistic inference, machine learning, natural language processing, and practical applications. \[3 credit units\].

## 3. Prerequisites  
CMPSCI 3130 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms) or Graduate Standing in CS

## 4. Learning outcomes  
This course consists of (a) the book's chapter topics in the form of [recorded lectures](./LECTURES.md) along with corresponding homeworks, (b) a collection of activities as a crash course on [machine learning using Keras/Tensorflow](https://github.com/badriadhikari/neural-networks-using-tensorflow), and (c) a semester-long [project](./PROJECT.md) on feed-forward neural networks. If you are new to artificial intelligence, Python, and machine learning, the activites and the project will require some exploration and study. But they provide you opportunities to learn the fundamentals of neural networks and the state-of-the art libraries to build prediction systems. Below are the learning outcomes:
* Use Python, Numpy and Keras to design, train, and evaluate basic feed-forward neural networks
* Learn artificial intelligence principles and approaches
* Learn a basic understanding of the building blocks of AI as presented in terms of intelligent agents
* Evaluate various searching algorithms
* Understand problems and ideas in the field of natural language processing, perception, and robotics
* Learn the philosophical foundations of AI and the future of AI
* Implement various AI algorithms such as depth-first search, and breadth-first search.

## 9. Academic dishonesty
Any form of academic dishonesty in this class will result in an F for the semester and the case will be referred to the provost's office for possible further disciplinary action, regardless of how trivial it is. Please don't use another student's assignment (or a solution in the internet) to complete your own assignment. Discussing the material is 'OK', but please do your work on your own. You should complete the homework alone, not together, and not in a group. If you have any questions about any of the lessons or the assignments, please contact me, and I will point you in the right direction. Please read [UMSL's policy](https://www.umsl.edu/services/academic/policy/academic-dishonesty.html) and keep yourself out of plagiarism. Also, please remember that our `turnitin` tool also automatically checks for plagiarism.

## 10. Programming language
Python3 is language for the course; you are expected to use Python3 for all of your classroom activities, homeworks, and project. You are also required to use [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) or your own hosted Jupyter Notebook for running your programs.

## 11. Due dates and late policy  
* Homeworks and project phases have their respective due dates (see Schedule).
* All activities will be graded before the last week of the semester (i.e. 12/01). You can resubmit activities as many times as you want. Your most recent submission will be graded.
* You can request a maximum two-day extension on any homeworks or project submissions - for up to two submissions. 
* If you email me a few hours before a deadline and I don't reply you immediately, and if you have not used your two-day extensions, you can assume that the extension is granted automatically.
* Once you use your extension days, late submissions will get no points.

## 12. Course project
* See [here](PROJECT.md).

## 13. Homeworks
There will be three types of homeworks: [project homeworks](./PROJECT.md), [drawing concept maps](./CONCEPT-MAPS.md) as chapter summaries, and some chapters have additional [homeworks](./HOMEWORKS.md). All homeworks should be submitted via Canvas. Concept maps should be submitted to the respective discussion boards so they are visible to other students in the class. You can view the concept maps uploaded by other students in the class only after you have submitted yours.

## 14. Grade composition  

| Submission | Total Points |
| :--- | ---: |
| Chapter concept maps | 10 |
| Chapter homeworks | 20 |

## 17. What students say

> "This course is like no other in the computer science department. Professor Badri went above and beyond to help us achieve the skills we will use in our work life after university. Many professors keep teaching the same theory stuff again and again and after the semester its impossible to recall what we studied but for this course we did a lot of programming and that we will remember and use in our actual life. I loved this class and other classes taught in this way." - A student in spring 2020 class.

> "I loved this course. Separating theory and programming was an excellent idea. I wish it was done for all courses." - A student in spring 2020 class.

> "I particularly liked all of these resources he provided to help us learn and guide us through the course." - A student in fall 2019 class.

> "I had not done Python programming before so I was bit lost at the beginning but the activity video lectures and sample Python notebooks helped me excel in the course. Being able to see the project report done by other students who had taken the course last semester was nice." - A student in fall 2019 class.
